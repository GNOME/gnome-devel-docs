    <para>
      GNOME is a project to build a complete desktop and development
      platform based entirely on free software.  Many companies,
      governments, schools, institutions, and individuals have
      deployed the GNOME desktop on their systems.  If you are a
      developer of third-party software ("Independent Software Vendor"
      or <acronym>ISV</acronym>), you may want to ensure that your
      existing software runs properly under GNOME.  This guide
      explains how to integrate existing software with GNOME, without
      actually rewriting that software to explicitly use the GNOME
      platform libraries and development tools.
    </para>

    <para>
      This guide will be useful in the following situations:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  You are a software developer or distributor who has an
	  application that is not explicitly designed to work with
	  GNOME, but you want to ensure that it runs comfortably
	  within a GNOME desktop.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  You are a system administrator for an institution that has
	  deployed GNOME desktops to its users.  You also have legacy
	  or in-house applications, and you want your users of GNOME
	  to be able to access those applications comfortably.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      In general, this guide is about integrating existing software
      into a GNOME desktop.  On the other hand, if you are considering
      writing new software, we encourage you to develop it completely
      with GNOME as your target platform; please refer to the <ulink
      url="http://developer.gnome.org">GNOME Developer's Site</ulink>
      for more information.
    </para>

    <para>
      One of the main concerns of GNOME is the user experience.  Users
      should have a comfortable computing environment:  this means
      having a complete desktop and a set of applications which
      operate together in a consistent way.  With relatively little
      work, applications which are not written explicitly with GNOME
      in mind can be made to run comfortably within a GNOME desktop.
    </para>

    <section id="structure">
      <title>Structure of this guide</title>

      <para>
	This guide is structured as a list of tasks that you need to
	perform to integrate existing software with GNOME.  The guide
	presents these tasks roughly in order of importance.  For
	example, the task of adding your application to the GNOME
	desktop's menus appears before the task for adding
	drag-and-drop support.  Also, this guide has an <link
	linkend="apx-integration-checklist">appendix with an
	integration checklist</link> to aid you in evaluating your
	integration work.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="standards">
      <title>Standards</title>

      <para>
	Many of the integration tasks in this guide rely on standards
	which are relevant to more than GNOME.  Other desktop projects
	like the <ulink url="http://www.kde.org">K Desktop
	Environment</ulink> also use these standards:  if you
	integrate your applications with GNOME, you should have to do
	little or no extra work to make them run in those other
	environments as well.
      </para>

      <!-- Do we need to mention KDE at all in the paragraph above?
      Can we eliminate "Other desktop projects..." and just say, "If
      you integrate ... no extra work to make them run in other
      environments which follow the same standards." -->

  <chapter id="panel-menus">
    <title>Putting your application in the desktop menus</title>

    <para>
      To run applications from GNOME, users click on icons on their
      desktops or they select the applications which they want to run
      from a menu.  Therefore, the first step in integrating an
      existing program with GNOME is to
      <firstterm>register</firstterm> it with the set of applications
      that users can run.
    </para>
  </chapter>

  <appendix id="apx-integration-checklist">
    <title>Integration Checklist</title>

    <para>
      This appendix provides a checklist of the various tasks
      presented through this guide.  You can use the checklist to
      ensure that your software is integrated into GNOME in at least
      the most basic ways, and also as a resource to plan for further
      integration work.
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Does your application appear in the <link
	  linkend="panel-menus">GNOME panel's menus</link>?
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Does your application have an icon for the panel menus or
	  the desktop?
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  If your application can load or save files, does it register
	  the MIME types that it can handle?
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Does your application provide MIME icons for the file
	  manager?
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  If your application creates "printable" documents, does it
	  install a thumbnailer for use by the file manager?
