    <para>
      GNOME is a project to build a complete desktop and development
      platform based entirely on free software.  Many companies,
      governments, schools, institutions, and individuals have
      deployed the GNOME desktop on their systems.  If you are a
      developer of third-party software ("Independent Software Vendor"
      or <acronym>ISV</acronym>), you may want to ensure that your
      existing software runs properly under GNOME.  This guide
      explains how to integrate existing software with GNOME, without
      actually rewriting that software to explicitly use the GNOME
      platform libraries and development tools.
    </para>

    <para>
      This guide will be useful in the following situations:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  You are a software developer or distributor who has an
	  application that is not explicitly designed to work with
	  GNOME, but you want to ensure that it runs comfortably
	  within a GNOME desktop.
	</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  You are a system administrator for an institution that has
	  deployed GNOME desktops to its users.  You also have legacy
	  or in-house applications, and you want your users of GNOME
	  to be able to access those applications comfortably.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      In general, this guide is about integrating existing software
      into a GNOME desktop.  On the other hand, if you are considering
      writing new software, we encourage you to develop it completely
      with GNOME as your target platform; please refer to the <ulink
      url="http://developer.gnome.org">GNOME Developer's Site</ulink>
      for more information.
    </para>

    <para>
      One of the main concerns of GNOME is the user experience.  Users
      should have a comfortable computing environment:  this means
      having a complete desktop and a set of applications which
      operate together in a consistent way.  With relatively little
      work, applications which are not written explicitly with GNOME
      in mind can be made to run comfortably within a GNOME desktop.
    </para>

    <section id="structure">
      <title>Structure of this guide</title>

      <para>
	This guide is structured as a list of tasks that you need to
	perform to integrate existing software with GNOME.  The guide
	presents these tasks roughly in order of importance.  For
	example, the task of adding your application to the GNOME
	desktop's menus appears before the task for adding
	drag-and-drop support.  Also, this guide has an <link
	linkend="apx-integration-checklist">appendix with an
	integration checklist</link> to aid you in evaluating your
	integration work.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="standards">
      <title>Standards</title>

      <para>
	Many of the integration tasks in this guide rely on standards
	which are relevant to more than GNOME.  Other desktop projects
	like the <ulink url="http://www.kde.org">K Desktop
	Environment</ulink> also use these standards:  if you
	integrate your applications with GNOME, you should have to do
	little or no extra work to make them run in those other
	environments as well.
      </para>

      <!-- Do we need to mention KDE at all in the paragraph above?
      Can we eliminate "Other desktop projects..." and just say, "If
      you integrate ... no extra work to make them run in other
      environments which follow the same standards." -->

    </section>
  </preface>

  <chapter id="panel-menus">
    <title>Putting your application in the desktop menus</title>

    <para>
      To run applications from GNOME, users click on icons on their
      desktops or they select the applications which they want to run
      from a menu.  Therefore, the first step in integrating an
      existing program with GNOME is to
      <firstterm>register</firstterm> it with the set of applications
      that users can run.
    </para>

    <para>
      Unlike in Windows or MacOS, in GNOME the users menus are
      automatically constructed from the list of registered
      applications. Each published application specifies a set of
      categories to which it belongs, and the systems menu
      configuration sorts and arranges them. This mechanism follows
      the freedesktop.org desktop entry and menu standards.
    </para>

    <note>
      Though common in other desktops, creating your own
      application-specific submenu is not recommended. Instead,
      provide one menu item for each application you ship. Extra items
      such as help files, READMEs or links to your web site should be
      embedded into the application itself.
    </note>

    <para>
      To add a menu entry for your application, create
      a <firstterm>.desktop file</firstterm>. It should have a unique
      filename, and there are no length limits so avoid abbreviations
      and feel free to include brand names. However, don't put spaces
      or international characters in the file name. For instance,
      "foocorp-painter-pro.desktop" would be a good filename to
      choose but "fcpp.desktop" would be a bad name, as would
      "FooCorp Painter Pro.desktop". The file should be UTF-8
      encoded, and should resemble the following template:
    </para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
      [Desktop Entry]
      Encoding=UTF-8
      Name=FooCorp Painter Pro
      Exec=foocorp-painter-pro
      Icon=foocorp-painter-pro
      Type=Application
      Categories=Application;
    ]]></programlisting>

    <!-- MH: should we have a section on file names and naming? One of
         the more stupid parts of how UNIX works is the filing system
         heirarchy standard: it means every app must have a unique
         name and there is no widely accepted registry.
      -->

    <para>
      These .desktop files contain metadata about your application,
      and play a central role in integrating the program with the
      GNOME and other standards compliant desktops. The template
      presented here is the most basic possible. The file can be
      linguistically translated so your applications name can appear
      in the users native language.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      This file can be put into
      the <literal>/usr/share/applications</literal> directory, or for
      the users personal menu
      into <literal>~/.local/share/applications</literal>. Which is
      used should depend on whether your application is installed
      systemwide or into a users home directory. GNOME monitors these
      directories for changes, simply copying the file to the right
      location is enough to register it with the desktop.
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that the <literal>~/.local/share/applications</literal>
      location is not monitored by versions of GNOME prior to version
      2.10 or on Fedora Core Linux, prior to version 2.8. These
      versions of GNOME follow the now deprecated vfolder standard,
      and so .desktop files must be installed
      to <literal>~/.gnome2/vfolders/applications</literal>. This
      location is not supported by GNOME 2.8 on Fedora Core nor on
      upstream GNOME 2.10 so for maximum compatibility with deployed
      desktops, put the file in both locations.

      <!-- MH: Actually I think some distros merge the old vfolders
           directory in so placing items in both locations will cause
           duplicate menu entries. Autopackage seems to have a program
           called "vfolder-magic" which modifies the vfolder
           definition in the users home directory. The comment at the
           top says:

           *  Program that adds or removes a desktop entry in
           *  ~/.gnome2/vfolders/applications.vfolder-info. This seems to be
           *  necessary with gnome 2.8, at least.

        -->

      <!-- MH: Though this is a GNOME ISV guide, as so much of the
           basic integration work is also compatible with KDE it would
           be wise in my opinion to mention KDE and observe any quirks
           that are necessary to integrate correctly with that
           too. There's no real reason not to, ISVs want the maximum
           userbase possible (indeed, is this not what separates ISVs
           from your average open source project?).

           In this case, when installing menu entries for KDE you must
           run kbuildsycocoa to force a refresh of the menus.
