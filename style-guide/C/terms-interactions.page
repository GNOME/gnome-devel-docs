 <title>Mouse and keyboard actions</title>
 <p>Users should be able to distinguish between actions which they have to perform with the mouse or with the keyboard, respectively.</p>

 <list>
  <item><p>To perform this action, click <gui>Apply</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>To perform this action, press <key>Enter</key>.</p></item>
 </list>

 <p>This is unique for the user to decide whether he has to click a button in the UI or to press a key on his keyboard. Please don't use it as follows:</p>

 <quote>
  <p>To perform this action, press the <gui>Apply</gui> button.</p>
 </quote>

 <p>In fact, we cannot <em>press</em> a button. The physical process <em>to press</em> isn't adaptable to a virtual object. Instead, we <em>click</em> with the mouse or another pointing device.</p>
