<title>Visual Design</title>

    <para>Visual design is not just about making your application look pretty.  Good visual design is about communication.  A well-designed application will make it easy for the user to understand the information that is being presented, and show them clearly how they can interact with that information.  If you can achieve all that, your application <emphasis>will</emphasis> look good to the user, even if it doesn't have any fancy graphics or spinning logos!</para>

      <title>Color</title>

      <para> Color is a good tool for communicating information in a user interface. It can be used to buttress a desktop's look and feel by enhancing a theme, accent a dynamic alert in a system management application, emphasize an element in a long list to expedite scanning, or add aesthetically pleasing details to an icon. However, color should always be regarded as a useful addition to your design, not as a necessity. Your design should never depend upon colors alone to display important information, and you should keep in mind that if colors cannot be perceived correctly for whatever reason (user has an 8-bit system or is colorblind), your application should still be usable. </para>

	<para>A basic thirty-two color palette has been developed for the GNOME desktop. It is public and may be downloaded from <ulink url="http://primates.ximian.com/~tigert/new_stock_project/">http://primates.ximian.com/~tigert/new_stock_project/</ulink>. You may save it to your ~/.gimp_1.2/palettes/ folder and restart GIMP to begin using it. A single, consistently used palette helps give a unified look and feel to the desktop while minimizing visual distractions. If you need a color that is darker or lighter than the colors in this basic palette (e.g., for antialiasing needs), choose a color that is closest to the hue you desire, then darken or lighten as needed.</para>

	<title>Hue, Brightness, Contrast</title>
	
	<para>Users with vision disorders, such as colorblindess or low vision, require alternatives to default settings. A good user interface is one that anticipates these needs by providing customizable preferences and support for accessible themes. Even better is an application that is already configured with carefully chosen defaults when it comes to color and contrast.</para>

	<para> Colorblind users constitute an estimated 11% of the world population and have trouble distinguishing between certain hues such as red and green (deuteranopia or protanopia) or blue and yellow (tritanopia). Therefore it is necessary to allow the user to customize colors in any part of your application that conveys important information. This means that your application should be able to effectively convey information using just the colors from any theme that the user chooses<!--, and that attributes such as hue and brighness are adjustable in your application's preferences dialog -->.</para>
	
	<para>A useful tool for reviewing information about colorblindess and checking legibility of images for colorblind users is <ulink url="http://www.vischeck.com/">Vischeck</ulink>, an online tool that simulates the way an image or a website might appear to a user who has deuteranopia, protanopia, or tritanopia. </para>

	<para>Other users have more problems when it comes to contrast levels rather than hue on their screen. Some users require a high level of contrast between background and foreground colors such as black on white, white on black, or some other high-contrast combination. Others can experience discomfort unless they use low-contrast settings, such as gray text on a lighter gray background. These needs can be met by making sure that your application supports accessible themes in GNOME, whether it be High Contrast Large Print, High Contrast, Low Contrast Large Print, Low Contrast, or Large Print. This means there is a need for large and default sizes of high, low, and normal-contrast icon sets that accompany the default set for your application (see the Icon Style section).</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Use the GNOME color palette. If you need a darker or lighter shade, start from one of the colors from the palette and darken or lighten as needed.</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>Ensure your application is not dependent on a particular theme. Test it with different themes (including high contrast accessibility themes, which use fewer colors) to ensure your application respects the settings. For example, all text should appear in the foreground color against the background color specified in the chosen theme.</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>Select colors carefully: when they need to be recognizably different, select the light colors from orange, yellow, green or blue-green, and darker colors from blue, violet, purple or red, since most colorblind people already see blue, violet, purple and red as darker than normal.</para></listitem>

	<para>Placement of visual components in an application is important because relationships between elements are usually indicated by their positions. This is called "layout" in interface design. A clean layout is crucial to creating a smooth visual flow of information for the user. In this section, you will be introduced to proper component placement and spacing. The major components discussed will be: labels, icons, radio buttons and checkboxes, text fields, command buttons, and drop-down menus.</para>

<!-- picture here of a complex preferences dialog, badly designed: right-aligned similar length labels, very little spacing between elements (vertically), varying spaces between elements (horizontally) -->

	<para> In this example, the dialog presents labels which are not left-aligned. The user's eye is not given a proper anchor to scan the dialog quickly.</para>

	<para>Since the labels are all similar in length, they should be left-aligned. Now the user has a firm left margin to anchor the eye and scan the list of items vertically with more ease. If most of the labels greatly differ in length in a component grouping within a layout, they should be right-aligned so that the components don't end up far away from the corresponding labels.</para>

	<para>Use of frames to separate component groupings within a layout is deprecated. Use spacing and bold headers instead to delineate categorization. The latter is more effective because there are less gratuitous lines to distract the user from the main content in a layout.</para>

	<para>Try to keep components consonant with each other in terms of size and alignment. This is particularly important within a component grouping in a layout so that the user's ability to quickly scan information is not sacrificed. Minimize the need for the user's eye to jump around too much when scanning a layout.</para>

	<para> Labels should be concise and make sense when taken out of context; otherwise, users relying on screenreaders or similar assistive technologies will not always be able to immediately understand the relationship between a control and those surrounding it.</para>

	<para>Labels of editable components should have access keys (underlined character for navigation by users unable to use a mouse), and the labels should immediately precede its control in the tab order so that the access key assigned to the label will focus to or activate the correct control when pressed.</para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2 id="window-layout-spacing">
	<title>Spacing and Alignment</title>

	<para>Provide adequate space between controls and groups of controls. This white space will make it easier for the user to find the information they need. A basic rule of thumb is to put space between user interface components in increments of 6 pixels, going up as the relationship between related elements becomes more distant. For example, between icon labels and associated graphics within an icon, 6 pixels are adequate. Between labels and associated componentts, it's good to leave 12 horizontal pixels. For vertical spacing between groups of components, 18 pixels is adequate. A general padding of 12 pixels is good to have between the contents of a dialog window and the window borders.</para>

	<para>Break long lists of choices into smaller groups. For lists of less than about eight items, use radio buttons or check boxes. For longer lists, use a list control or option menu.</para>

	<para>Try to keep elements of the same type correspond to each other in left justification. For instance, titles of component groupings as in figure ("General," "Actions") should be left-aligned and justified with each other. Indentation of, say, 12 to 18 pixels is useful to denote hierarchy and association. By the same token, aim to minimize the number of alignment points in your window. An alignment point is an imaginary vertical or horizontal line through your window which touches the edge of one or more labels or controls in the window. Right justification is pleasing to the eye but not crucial.</para>
	
	<para>Guidelines:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>DO lay out components left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Generally, the first element the user is meant to encounter should be in the top-left, and the last in the bottom right. Keep in mind that when localized for non-western locales, interfaces may be reversed so that they read from right to left.</para></listitem>

    		<listitem><para>DO space in increments of 6 pixels; using "white" or blank spacing and indentation to delineate component groupings is cleaner and preferable than using graphical separators such as "title borders" or frames.

			</itemizedlist>
		</para></listitem>

    		<listitem><para>Align controls in your layout EXACTLY. The eye is very sensitive to aligned and unaligned objects. If nothing lines up with anything else in a window, it will be very hard for the user to scan the contents and find the information he wants. Two things that almost line up, but not quite, are equally distracting.</para></listitem>

    		<listitem><para>Be consistent. Use the same spacing, alignment, and component sizes in all dialogs appearing in your application. The OK and Cancel buttons, for example, should all appear exactly 12 vertical and horizontal pixels from the lower right corner of every dialog window.</para></listitem>

    		<listitem><para>Ensure that light and dark areas as well as spacing are equally distributed around the window. Keep in mind that every control or group of controls in your window has a visual "weight," depending on its overall size, color, and how much white space it includes. Darker, larger areas are "heavier," while paler, smaller areas are "lighter."</para></listitem>

    		<listitem><para>Do not design windows that are more than 50% longer in one dimension than in the other. People are more comfortable looking at windows and dialogs whose dimensions stay within the golden ratio (about 1.6 to 1), a ratio that artists and architects have used to create aesthetically-pleasing buildings and paintings for thousands of years.</para></listitem>
	 	
    		<!-- <para><listitem>Do not resize components to fit arbitrary or uncommon layout needs. Make it a practice to use GtkTables, GtkVBox and GtkHBox container widgets at their default /* Calum, is there such a thing? */ row, column and border sizes.

To a visually-impaired user who may not be able to see or understand any additional graphical output, clear textual output is critical. it is therefore essential that you choose and position text carefully on the screen, and leave the choice of fonts and sizes to the user, to ensure that all users are able to use your application effectively.</para>

	<para>Many widgets give you little or no choice about the positioning of the label, such as buttons or check boxes.  However, with text boxes, lists, option menus and others, it is up to you as the designer to choose the best position for the control's label.</para>

-->

	<para>Guidelines:</para>
	
	<itemizedlist>
	 <listitem><para>If the label precedes the control it is labelling, end the label with a colon . For example, <guilabel>Email:</guilabel> to label a text field into which the user should type their email address. This helps identify it as a control's label rather than an independent item of text.</para></listitem>
	  
	<listitem><para>When you use static text to label a control, ensure that the label immediately precedes that control in the Tab order. This will ensure that the access key (underlined character) you assign to the label will move focus to or activate the correct control when pressed.</para></listitem>

	 <listitem><para>Left align components and labels. Right-align labels only when most of the labels greatly differ in length in a component grouping, so that some of the components don't end up too far away from the corresponding labels.</para></listitem>


	<listitem><para>Choose label names carefully. Label objects with names that make sense when taken out of context. Users relying on screenreaders or similar assistive technologies will not always be able to immediately understand the relationship between a control and those surrounding it.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Be consistent with label use and semantics. For example, if you use the same label in different windows, it will help if it means the same thing in both windows. By the same token, don't use labels that are spelled differently but sound the same, e.g., "Read" and "Red", as this could be confusing for users relying on screenreaders.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Label unambiguously.  For example, don't use the same label more than once in the same window.</para></listitem>
 
	<listitem><para>Do not hard-code font styles and sizes. The user should be able to adjust all sizes and typefaces. If for some reason you cannot make this functionality available, never hardcode any font sizes smaller than 10 points.</para></listitem>
 
	<listitem><para>Do not use more than two or three different fonts and sizes in your application, and choose visually distinct rather than similar-looking fonts in one window. Too many font sizes and styles will make the interface look cluttered and unprofessional, and be harder to read. In general, you should always use fonts from the current theme, and specify relative rather than absolute sizes.</para></listitem>
 
	  <listitem><para>Do not use graphical backdrops or &quot;watermarks&quot; behind text, other than those specified by the user's chosen theme. Such images interfere with the contrast between the text and its background.  This can cause difficulty for users with visual impairments, who will therefore normally choose themes that always use plain backdrops.</para></listitem>

	<title>Fonts and Capitalization</title>

	<para>Use sans-serif fonts for better legibility, 12 point is usually a sufficient default for users of normal vision. Don't use too many different kinds of font styles (underlined, bold, italicized) in one context because they will distract the user from the information being conveyed. Also be sure to use capitalization consistently throughout your application. A general rule of thumb is: use sentence capitalization where length of text is longer or is less of an issue (text to the right of associated components), and if the text is functioning more as an explanation than a label.</para>

      <para>The layout of a user interface is important both because it communicates the relationships between elements, and because an aesthetically-pleasing interface is more pleasant to use.</para>
      
      <para>Users in western locales are accustomed to reading from the top-left to the bottom-right. Generally, therefore, lay out your interface so that the first element the user is meant to encounter is in the top-left, and the last in the bottom-right.</para>
      
      <para>Bear in mind that when localized for non-western locales, interfaces may be reversed so that they read from right to left.</para>

	<para>Guidelines:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>Aim to minimize the number of alignment points in your window.  An alignment point is an imaginary vertical or horizontal line through your window with which touches the edge of one or more labels or controls in the window.</para>

	<title>Balance and Proportion</title>
	
	<para>Even if you choose all the right controls for your dialog, and arrange them in all the right groups, it still might not look quite right on the screen.  One possible reason for this is that you've got the &quot;visual balance&quot; wrong.</para>
	
	<para>Visual balance works like balancing weights.  Every control or group of controls in your window has a visual 'weight', depending on its overall size, color, and how much white space it includes.  Darker, larger areas are 'heavier'.  Paler, smaller areas are 'lighter'.  The more balanced your window is overall, the more comfortable users will feel when they look at it.</para>

	<para>FIXME: Example of unbalanced and balanced About dialog</para>

	<tip><title>Checking Visual Balance</title>
	  <para>There are two good ways to check if a window has good visual balance.  First, screw up your eyes just enough to hide the details of the window, and see if the light and dark areas seem to be equally distributed around the window.  Second, print out a screenshot of your dialog, and look at it in a mirror, again screwing up your eyes a little.  If it still looks balanced, it probably is.</para>
	</tip>

	<para>As with visual balance, people can feel uncomfortable if things look out of proportion.  In nature, there is a ratio called the golden ratio&mdash;about 1.6 to 1&mdash; that crops up all over the place from tree trunks to snail shells.  Artists and architects have known about this for thousands of years, and used it to create aesthetically-pleasing buildings and paintings.</para>

	<para>It also turns out that people are more comfortable looking at windows and dialogs whose dimensions stay within the golden ratio.  So, where possible, don't design windows that are more than about 50% longer in one dimension than they are in the other.</para>

    <sect1 id="color-and-contrast">
      <title>Color and Contrast</title>

      <para>Poor choice of colors on the screen can cause problems for users with color blindness (for whom hue is important) or low-vision (for whom brightness/contrast is important). For example, some users require a high level of contrast between the background and text colors&mdash; black on white, white on black, or some other high-contrast combination. Others can experience discomfort unless they use low contrast settings, such as gray text on a lighter gray background.</para>

      <para>Colorblindness alone affects an estimated 2% of all females, and 9% of all males.  You must therefore allow the user to customize the colors in any part of your application that conveys important information.  Normally, this means you should only use colors that are part of the user's chosen theme.  If you have to use any extra colors, they must be customizable in your application's <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel> dialog.</para>
      
      <figure id="redundant-color-example">

      <para>Design colored elements, such as icons, in black and white first, then add the color later.  If the design works in black and white, you can be fairly sure that the color you add will be redundant, and used only to reinforce the black and white design.  See <xref linkend="icons"/> for more information.</para>

If for some reason you do need to use colors that are not available in the theme, make those colors customizable within your application's <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel> dialog.
