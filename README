patches or suggesting document changes.

The HIG is fragmented into a number of DocBook XML files,
each containing a chapter. To generate HTML output try
running 'build-hig.sh'. If you are lucky output will be
generated in ./hig. Many systems are not properly 
setup to build DocBook  "out of the box". If you need
help getting DocBook setup properly try the #docs IRC
channel on irc.gnome.org.

For a "crash course" in DocBook, see:

The DocBook reference is available at:
