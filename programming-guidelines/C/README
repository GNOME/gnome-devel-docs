This is the GNOME Programming Guidelines, a style guide for writing
code for GNOME, and things we have learned over the years that make
the GNOME project easier to follow.

The original Programming Guidelines document is included, for
nostalgia, as old-programming-guidelines.ps - I couldn't find the
original sources in a friendlier format.
