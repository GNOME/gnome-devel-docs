This module is for developer documents which are to be shipped in the
gnome-devel-docs package, typically with the Fifth Toe packages.


Please respect the directory structure:
  gnome-devel-docs/<group>/<docname>/<locale>/<docname>.sgml
  gnome-devel-docs/<group>/<docname>/<locale>/figures/

For <group>, we want to group documents into a standard group, such as:
  white-papers
  tutorials
  projects  (where project refers to GDP, GSP, GTP, ...
             for these, nest one level deeper:
             eg: gnome-devel-docs/projects/gdp/gdp-handbook/C/... )

In some cases, it may make sense to nest things one level deeper.  However,
do not nest things less deep.  If you have questions, please email me.

****
Please do not put unmaintained documents or documents which are not
likely to be finished and shippable soon in this module.
