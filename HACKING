This module is for developer documents which are to be shipped in the
gnome-devel-docs package, typically with the Fifth Toe packages.


Please respect the directory structure:
  gnome-devel-docs/<group>/<docname>/<locale>/<docname>.sgml
  gnome-devel-docs/<group>/<docname>/<locale>/figures/

For <group>, we want to group documents into a standard group, such as:
  * articles     (article-style discussion of a topic)
  * books        (books which were printed)
  * faqs         (FAQ-style documents)
  * projects     (organizational documents for particular GNOME projects, 
                  such as the GAP, GDP, GTP, GUP, etc. 
                  for these, nest one level deeper:
                  eg: gnome-devel-docs/projects/gdp/gdp-handbook/C/... 
                  For general GNOME organizational documents, use
                  "GNOME" as the project.)
  * tutorials    (step-by-step tutorials)
  * white-papers (in-depth discussion of a particular technical part of GNOME)

In some cases, it may make sense to nest things one level deeper.  However,
do not nest things less deep.  If you have questions, please email me.

****
Please do not put unmaintained documents or documents which are not
likely to be finished and shippable soon in this module.  Please use
gnome-docu or another module for such documents.

This module is for Free documentation.  Please contact the maintainer
