"Because GNOME aims to be an international desktop, it needs to avoid imagery "

"eyes), will be considered tasteless or gross to another (such as a nose). "
"Based on a survey of icons in GNOME, body parts frequently appear in the "

"situations body parts should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used. Even in "

"objects in reference to themselves (show someone a bat and they will think "
