<title>Icons and artwork</title>

<p>Icons play an important role in user interfaces: selecting the correct icon is therefore vital to making sure that your application is usable. An identifying icon is also an essential part of any application, and is a crucial part of its identity.</p>

<section id="using-icons">
<title>Using icons in your user interface</title>

<p>There are many situations when it is necessary to decide between using an icon and a text label, particularly for buttons. Icons have the advantage of being smaller, and not requiring translation. At the same time, the incorrect use of an icon can make your interface hard - or even impossible - to understand.</p>

<list>
<item><p>Only use icons whose meaning is commonly recognized. If a commonly recognized icon is not available, it might be better to use a text label instead.</p>
<list>
<item><p>Convention establishes which icons will be recognized. If you are in doubt, stick to icons which are frequently used in other applications.</p></item>
<item><p>Consider which icons will be meaningful in the specific context of your application - users of specialist tools will often be familiar with domain-specific symbols.</p></item>
</list></item>
<item><p>Remember that some icons are only meaningful alongside other icons of the same type. For example, a media icon for stop is simply a square, and may not be identified as a stop icon without other media controls (like play, pause, or skip) being visible close by. Likewise, the icon to remove an item from a list is a subtract symbol (ie. a single line), and will not be recognizable without a corresponding “plus” add icon.</p></item>

<section id="color-vs-symbolic">
<title>Color vs. symbolic icons</title>

<p>GNOME 3 provides two types of icon: full-color and monochrome symbolic icons. The guidelines in this HIG indicate when to use which type of icon. The following is a a general guide.</p>

<p>Full-color icons should be used for:</p>

<list>
<item><p>devices</p></item>
<item><p>filetypes/mimetypes</p></item>
<item><p>application (launcher) icons</p></item>
</list>

<p>All other icons should use the symbolic icon style. In addition, symbolic icons should always be used inside:</p>

<list>
<item><p>buttons</p></item>
<item><p>lists</p></item>
<item><p>entry fields</p></item>
<item><p>when the background is semi-transparent (such as overlaid media or fullscreen controls)</p></item>
</list>

<section id="application-icons">
<title>Application icons</title>

<p>Every application should have a unique and beautiful application icon. It is the face of the application, and the first visual element a user sees when browsing for new applications. The <link xref="application-basics">application basics page</link> includes details on what an application is, and when to provide an application icon.</p>

<p>The nominal size of application icons is 512x512px. Application icons are, however, rarely rendered at this resolution. As display density started varying immensely, sticking to absolute pixel units has also become less practical.</p>

<p>Because the application icon still get presented at lower resolution, the icon should feature only detail presentable at 64x64px resolution. The density of detail should not be higher, because it would get lost by filtering/scaling down.</p>

<p>The default template includes an 8px grid which should help you avoid adding detail that's finer than the desired threshold.</p>

<media type="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/icons/sizes.svg"/>

<p>Application icons are mostly presented big, but the low level of detail will help when the icon is rendered at lower resolutions, such as System Settings panels.</p>

</section>

<section id="custom-symbolic-icons">
<title>Custom symbolic icons</title>

<p>Symbolic icons have a simple form and are drawn within a 16x16 pixel grid. They are then programmatically scaled and colored within the user interface itself.</p>

<list>
<item><p>Identify a single property when looking for an appropriate metaphor for an icon, and focus on what distinguishes the idea you want to communicate. For example, when describing an action to be performed on an image, it isn’t necessary to repeat the idea of an image in every icon. Instead, focus on what is distinct about each action (for example: rotate, tag, align).</p></item>
<item><p>Avoid using any perspective in symbolic icons, stick to a simple orthogonal view.</p></item>
<item><p>When using unfilled strokes for an outline, try avoiding hairline (1px) and do at least a 2px stroke for the meain feature of the icon. </p></item>
<item><p>Symbolic icons are recolored at runtime to match the context, very much like a piece of text. While there are ways to “shade” parts of an icon by using opacity or creating duotone/pattern dithering, try avoiding these as much as possible.</p></item>
<item><p>When a metaphor relies on the negative space, make sure it will work with the colors inverted. For example a camera lens spec/highlight will only work if lighter than the lens itself.</p></item>
</list>

<section id="size-and-grid">
<title>Size and grid</title>

<p>While the icons are scalable and should work in any size, the basic canvas size is 16x16 grid units. You have the whole canvas to fill, but note that a filled rectangular object will appear stronger/larger when placed next to items that only use thinner strokes. Try to keep the contrast of your whole set.</p>

<title>Custom full-color icons</title>

<p>Full-color icons are drawn and rendered at a variety of preset sizes.</p>

<section id="perspective">
<title>Perspective</title>

<p>Most icons can be executed best by using the “on the table” perspective, as if the observer was standing in front of the object and looking slightly down on it. Many icons can be rendered with a simple “straight on” or “on the shelf” perspective, with the observer looking directly at the object at eye level.</p>

<section id="palette">
<title>Palette</title>

<p>Use the Tango color palette when designing full color application or device icons.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><p>Butter</p></td>
<td><media type="image" mime="image/svg" src="figures/icons/palette/butter.svg"/></td>
<td><p>Plum</p></td>
<td><media type="image" mime="image/svg" src="figures/icons/palette/plum.svg"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Orange</p></td>
<td><media type="image" mime="image/svg" src="figures/icons/palette/orange.svg"/></td>
<td><p>Scarlet Red</p></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Sky Blue</p></td>
<td><media type="image" mime="image/svg" src="figures/icons/palette/sky-blue.svg"/></td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>You are free to use different shades of these colors depending on the desired material effect. However, these primary colors are a good baseline to start from. All major libre graphics packages come with the Tango palette pre-installed.</p>

<title>GNOME Icon Pack</title>

<p>To avoid starting from scratch, we prepared a selection of commonly used icons you can include in your application, or create derivatives of. The set is licensed CC0, so they can be used regardless of your project's license.</p>

<p>FIXME: link to a non-existant library.</p>
