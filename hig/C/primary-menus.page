<title>Primary menus</title>

<media type="image" mime="image/svg" src="figures/patterns/primary-menu.svg"/>

<p>Primary menus are a standard design pattern that is found in most applications. They are labelled with the menu icon (named <code>menu-open</code>) and contain the top-level menu items for the application. This can include standard items like <gui>Preferences</gui>, <gui>Help</gui> and <gui>About Application</gui>, as well as other application-specific items.</p>

<title>When to use</title>

<p>Most applications have primary menus, since they are the standard location for <gui>About Application</gui>, which every application is expected to have.</p>

<title>Guidance</title>

<p>Primary menus are typically placed on the right side of the header bar. However, there are two variations on this rule:</p>

<list>
<item><p>If the application incorporates in-window navigation, with a top-level location and sub-pages, the primary menu should only be placed on the top level: sub-pages can include a <link xref="secondary-menus">secondary menu</link>, if a menu is required.</p></item>
<item><p>When used in combination with a <link xref="sidebar-lists">sidebar list</link>, the primary menu should be placed above the sidebar list on the right. If a menu is required for items shown in the content side of the window, a <link xref="secondary-menus">secondary menu</link> can be used.</p></item>
</list>

<p>Other guidelines:</p>

<list>
<item><p>Primary menus can contain items for both the current window or view, as well as the application as a whole. This differentiates them from <link xref="secondary-menus">secondary menus</link>, which only contain menu items that relate to a specific view or item.</p></item>
<item><p>Follow the <link xref="menus">standard guidelines for menus</link> when deciding on primary menu content and arrangement.</p></item>
<item><p>A primary menu is contained within a <link xref="popovers">popover</link>. As such, a primary menu can include a variety of controls, such as groups of buttons.</p></item>
</list>

<section id="standard-menu-items">
<title>Standard menu items</title>

<p>The following are standard primary menu items, and should be placed in a group at the end of the menu:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><p><gui>Preferences</gui></p></td>
<td><p>Opens the application's preferences dialog, if it has one.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><gui>Keyboard Shortcuts</gui></p></td>
<td><p>Opens the application's keyboard shortcuts window, if it has one.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><gui>Help</gui></p></td>
<td><p>Opens the application's user documentation in the <app>Help</app> application.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><gui>About Application</gui></p></td>
<td><p>Opens the application's about dialog. This item should include the application's name, such as <gui>About Photos</gui> or <gui>About Calculator</gui>. Every primary menu should include this item.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Primary menus shouldnâ€™t include menu items for close or quit: windows can already be closed using the close button in the header bar, and it can be ambiguous as to what a close menu item refers to. Users don't readily differentiate between quit and close, and it can therefore be misleading.</p>
