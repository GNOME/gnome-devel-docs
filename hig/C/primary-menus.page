<title>Primary menus</title>

<media type="image" mime="image/svg" src="figures/patterns/primary-menu.svg"/>

<p>Primary menus are a standard design pattern that is found in most applications. They are labelled with the menu icon (named <code>menu-open</code>) and contain the top-level menu items for the application. This can include standard items like <gui>Preferences</gui>, <gui>Help</gui> and <gui>About</gui>, as well as other application-specific items.</p>

<p>Primary menus are typically located on the right side of the header bar. When used in combination with a <link xref="sidebar-lists">sidebar list</link>, the primary menu should be placed above the sidebar list.</p>

<p>Most applications have primary menus, since they are the standard location for <gui>About</gui>, which every application is expected to have.</p>

<item><p>Primary menus can contain items for both the current window or view, as well as the application as a whole. This differentiates them from <link xref="secondary-menus">secondary menus</link>, which only contain menu items that relate to a specific view or item.</p></item>
<item><p>Applications which use in-window navigation should only show the primary menu on the top-level view (typically the main view that is shown when the app is launched). Child views, such as those that show individual items of content, should use <link xref="secondary-menus">secondary</link> rather than primary menus.</p></item>
<item><p>Follow the <link xref="menus">standard guidelines for menus</link> when deciding on primary menu content and arrangement.</p></item>
<item><p>A primary menu is contained within a <link xref="popovers">popover</link>. As such, a header bar menu can include a variety of controls, such as groups of buttons.</p></item>
<item><p>Primary menus shouldnâ€™t include menu items for close or quit: windows can already be closed using the close button in the header bar, and it can be ambiguous as to what a close menu item refers to. Users don't readily differentiate between quit and close, and it can therefore be misleading.</p></item>
