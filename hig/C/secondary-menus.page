<title>Secondary menus</title>

<p>Secondary menus are located in the header bar and include menu items for the current view or content item. This differentiates them from <link xref="primary-menus">primary menus</link>, which include menu items that relate to an entire application (such as <gui>Preferences</gui> and <gui>About "Name"</gui>).</p>

<title>When to use</title>

<p>Secondary menus can be used to host controls that relate to a particular content item which is being displayed in the application window (such as a document, contact, conversation or photo). They are typically used in combination with in-window navigation or <link xref="sidebar-lists">sidebar lists</link>, since both these arrangements feature separate views or areas for content items to be shown.</p>

<p>Secondary menus are optional and only need to be used if there are enough controls to require a menu.</p>
