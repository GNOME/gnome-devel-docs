<title>In-app notifications</title>

<p>Information popups which can be displayed inside an application. An in-app notification includes a label which describes an event which has happened, and can also include a button that allows the user to respond. They are always transient and user dismissable.</p>

<title>When to use</title>

<p>In-app notifications are appropriate when you want to inform the user about an event that is relevant and specific to their ongoing use of the application. They are best used to provide immediate feedback. This contrasts with <link xref="notifications">standard notifications</link>, which alert the user whatever application they are using, and which persist after the notification has been initially displayed.</p>

<p>Allowing the user to undo a destructive action is a good example of an in-app notification: it is an immediate response to user action, is most relevant within a short space of time, and provides a button that allows the user to respond.</p>

<p>In-app notifications are not a good solution for communicating ongoing states. <link xref="info-bars">Info bars</link> and progress <link xref="progress-spinners">spinners</link> and <link xref="progress-bars">bars</link> offer some alternatives here.</p>

<list>
<item><p>It isn't always necessary to include an action button in an in-app notification: only include one if it is directly related to the event, and is generally useful.</p></item>
<item><p>Don't distract with unnecessary in-app notifications, such as alerting to irrelevant background processes.</p></item>
<item><p>Be careful not to overuse in-app notifications: they can be annoying if they pop up frequently.</p></item>
<item><p>Only one in-app notification can be displayed at a time, and new instances should replace existing ones.</p></item>
