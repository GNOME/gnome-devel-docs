  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
   GNOME is a large free software project which is 
   created by the collaborative efforts of many people, most of
   whom work on GNOME as volunteers in their free time.  Some 
   GNOME contributors are paid to work on GNOME as part of their 
   <quote>day job</quote>, but a minority of GNOME contributors fall 
   into this group.  The success and direction of GNOME relies on the
   efforts and ideas of all GNOME contributors and the GNOME project 
   welcomes all contributions, from both individuals and corporations.
  </para>
  <para>
   Individual contributors will find that GNOME is a fun and exciting 
   project, and they will meet and collaborate with many of the 
   field's top developers on cutting-edge technology.  Corporations 
   who join the GNOME project will learn that free software development 
   is a very efficient way to produce high-quality stable software, 
   and that the GNOME development platform makes developing powerful, 
   stable software easy.
  </para>
  <para>
   This document will help the new GNOME contributor decide which
   part of GNOME to work on, who within the GNOME project they should
   contact, and how to get started.

  <title>Choosing The Right Job For You</title>

  <para>
   Creating a large project like GNOME requires many people who
   contribute in various ways.  Not only do we need programmers who
   can write the GNOME development platform and many GNOME applications,
   we also need graphic artists, documentation writers, translators,
   web designers, software testers, software packagers, user interface
   designers, and many other people.  Whatever your particular interests
   or skills, you can probably use them to improve GNOME. 
  </para>

  <sect2 id="suggestions">
   <title>Suggestions On How To Contribute</title>
   <para>
    The first step in joining the GNOME project is determining how to
    contribute.  You can typically decide how to contribute by considering
    what your skills and interests are.  You may find the following list 
    of suggestions helpful:

      <formalpara>
       <title>Accessibility</title>
       <para>
        The GNOME accessibility work makes GNOME usable by people with
        various disabilities which may otherwise make using GNOME
        difficult or impossible.  In order to make GNOME accessible,
        work must be done from the Gtk+ widget set up to end-user
        applications such as screen readers and on-screen keyboards.
        It is also necessary to provide support for various special
        hardware devices such as special pointers and input devices.
        For a nice overview of accessibility and the accessibility
        work going on in GNOME, visit the <ulink type="http"

       <title>Documentation</title>
       <para>
        Documenting GNOME is a huge job.  GNOME documentation includes
        user documents, such as application manuals, the 
        <citetitle>GNOME User FAQ</citetitle>, and <citetitle>Introduction
        to GNOME</citetitle>, and developer documents
        such as GNOME technology white papers, developer tutorials,
        the <citetitle>GNOME Developer FAQ</citetitle>, and API 
        documentation.  In addition to document writers, we also need
        editors and indexers.  For information on the GNOME 
        Documentation Project and instructions for joining, see

       <title>Graphics</title>
       <para>
        GNOME needs various types of graphics.  Graphics are necessary
        for the GNOME web pages, desktop and menu icons, and various
        other places inside particular applications.  High-quality graphics
        are essential to produce an attractive and intuitive user 
        experience.  For information on contributing graphics to GNOME,
        see <xref linkend="joininggraphics">.

      <formalpara>
       <title>Packing</title>
       <para>
        Packaging takes source code, either released packages or
        source taken from CVS, and produces binary and source packages
        for distribution and installation.  The binaries of released
        packages are used by GNOME users as well as by distributions
        who re-package GNOME.  Without these reference packages,
        people who re-distribute GNOME often make mistakes when
        packaging GNOME. The CVS snapshot packages are used by
        testers, translators, documentation writers, and other
        developers so that they can keep up with the current
        development versions of software.  Thus, they are very
        important to allow GNOME developers to make GNOME as complete
        and stable as possible, and to make high quality packages
        available to as many users as possible.

       <title>Translation</title>
       <para>
        Translating GNOME is an ongoing process which requires many 
        volunteers.  For each language which GNOME is translated into,
        the strings used in the dialogs, menus, and buttons of each 
        application must be translated. Once this is done, the user
        manuals for each application as well as some general documents
        such as the <citetitle>GNOME User FAQ</citetitle>, 
        <citetitle>Introduction to GNOME</citetitle>, and 
        <citetitle>The GNOME User's Guide</citetitle> should also
        be translated for a fully localized GNOME experience.  For 
        information on joining the GNOME Translation Project, see

       <title>User Interface/Human Interface</title>
       <para>
        Determining the most intuitive and easy-to-use interface for
        applications is very important and takes a lot of work and
        experience.  If you have experience or an interest in making
        GNOME easier for users to interact with, see

       <title>Sounds</title>
       <para>
        GNOME needs sounds for various GNOME desktop events, applications,
        games, etc.  GNOME currently has a quite limited set of sounds
        which could be expanded and improved dramatically.  If
        you have the skills and/or equipment to create and work with
        sounds, consider helping produce more high-quality sounds for 
        GNOME.  For more information, see <xref linkend="joiningsound">.

      <formalpara>
       <title>Packaging</title>
       <para>
        It is very important that applications be properly packaged,
        making it easy for users to find and install the applications
        they want.  In many cases, this is packaging individual applications
        into RPMs and debs.  In some cases, it is packaging a group
        of similar applications into one package for 
        distribution (tgz,rpm,deb). For information on packaging
        GNOME applications, see <xref linkend="joiningpackaging">.

       <title>Web Design and Development</title>
       <para>
        The web pages are typically the first impression one gets of
        a software project and it also generally the first place users
        (and often developers) go to find further information about it.
        The <ulink type="http" url="http://www.gnome.org">main GNOME
        web page</ulink> and the <ulink type="http" 
        url="http://developer.gnome.org">GNOME developer web pages</ulink>
        take quite a bit of work to maintain and improve to suit the
        expanding needs of the rapidly growing GNOME user and developer
        bases.  Further, some tasks require an understanding of php, 
        mysql, wml, or other scripting in order to present and 
        store information in databases or process information which is 
        stored in CVS.  For information on helping with the GNOME web 
        pages, see <xref linkend="joiningweb">.

       <title>Testing</title>
       <para>
        In order to make GNOME completely stable, intuitive, and 
        bug-free, we need testers who can use applications 
        extensively, keeping an eye out for bugs and reporting
        them to the <ulink type="http"
        url="http://bugs.gnome.org/">GNOME bug tracking 
        database</ulink>.  For information on testing GNOME

       <title>Application Development</title>
       <para>
        We can never have enough good GNOME applications.  You can
        either start your own application or join an existing project.
        In many cases, it may be better to join an existing project
        as it is better to have a few polished applications than many
        incomplete applications.  It also gives the developer the benefit
        of meeting, working with, and learning from other GNOME 
        developers.  For information on selecting a project to
        work on and getting started developing see

       <title>Developer Tool Development</title>
       <para>
        Developers use many tools.  Application authors may use
        GUI-builders (eg. Glade), IDEs, string-handling tools
        (gettext), debuggers, memory profilers (memprof), 
        revision control systems (CVS), build tools (autoconf,
        automake), and many other tools.  Artists, documentation
        authors, translators, and other contributors all need
        their own set of tools to improve the quality of their
        work and their development rate.  There are many places
        where important tools are lacking or inadequate.  For more

 <sect1 id="gettingstarted">
  <title>Getting Started</title>

  <para>
   The previous section should have helped you decide which
   part of GNOME you would like to contribute to.  This section
   should help you get started.  The first part of the section
   introduces you to the standard GNOME methods of communication:
   email and IRC.  The latter part provides more detailed information
   on how to join particular parts of the GNOME project.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="gnomecommunication">
   <title>Standard GNOME Communication</title>
   <para>
    Because most GNOME developers are volunteers spread across 
    the world, almost all communication is electronic.  Aside
    from direct email between contributors, the primary
    communication tools are the mailing lists and IRC.
   </para>
   <sect3 id="mailinglists">
    <title>Mailing Lists</title>
    <para>
     There are many GNOME mailing lists for discussing the 
     various aspects and applications in GNOME.  You
     can find a list of GNOME mailing lists <ulink type="http" 
     url="http://www.gnome.org/resources/mailing-lists.html">here</ulink>,
     along with information on subscribing and links to their 
     archives.  New contributors are encouraged to join the 
     relevant mailing list(s) and introduce themselves and 
     what they are planning on working on.  If you do not
     know exactly what you want to work on, consider sending
     an email to the mailing list asking for suggestions on
     how you could contribute.  Be sure to indicate what your
     interests and skills are in your email. 
    </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3 id="irc">
    <title>IRC: Internet Relay Chat</title>
    <para>
     GNOME contributors use IRC (Internet Relay Chat) heavily.
     If you are not familiar with IRC, it is a tool which allows
     multiple people to communicate in real time by typing into
     a common window.  The main power of this system is that it
     is essentially real-time, as opposed to email where one
     typically has to wait minutes, hours, or even days  before 
     getting a response.
    </para>
    <para>
     Using IRC is simple.  First, you need to find an IRC client.
     If you are running GNOME, then you should have the 
     excellent IRC client <application>Xchat</application>
     installed already.  There are many other IRC clients to
     choose from, on Linux as well as on other platforms, but
     <application>Xchat</application> is one of the best.
     All GNOME IRC channels can be found on the irc.gnome.org
     server.  You can connect to this server by typing
     <command>/server irc.gnome.org</command> into the IRC 
     client's message entry box.  To join a given channel, you
     use the <command>join</command> command.  So to join the
     Gnumeric channel which is #gnumeric, you would type 
     <command>/join #gnumeric</command>.
    </para>
    <para>
     There are many GNOME channels on irc.gnome.org including:
     #gnome, #gnome-help, #nautilus, #docs, #i18n, #guppi, 
     #gnumeric, #interface, #gtk+, #evolution, and #medusa. 
     For a complete list, type <command>/list</command> after 
     you have connected to the irc.gnome.org server.
    </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3 id="integrating">
    <title>Integrating into GNOME</title>
    <para>
     Here are a few tips for integrating into the GNOME project:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Individuals who are paid to work on GNOME by companies should
        try to become part of the GNOME community as if they were
        volunteers. This means participating in the mailing lists
        and IRC discussions and being open about your intentions and
        opinions.  It also means you should use GNOME CVS in the same
        way volunteers do.  The open environment of GNOME is quite
        different from that of many companies but is the key to GNOME's
        success.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Don't be afraid to speak up.  The mailing lists and IRC tend
        to be chaotic but newcomers are always welcome.  If you don't
        get your answer on the first try, try again or try a different
        mailing list or IRC channel.  You might also consider trying
        at another time of the day - some IRC channels become quiet
        at certain times of the day, depending upon what time zone
        you are in.

    Finding the right contact person for a particular task can
    be difficult at times.  For many applications, the contact
    person is listed in the About dialog or the <filename>README</filename>

  <title>Learning to Develop</title>

  <para>
   GNOME is a great development platform largely because the 
   GNOME widgets and libraries handle many of the more tedious 
   tasks a developer must tackle, allowing the
   developer to focus on the primary parts of their application.
   Since the core GNOME development team has put a lot of work into
   developing these core GNOME technologies, they are generally of
   much higher quality than applications could typically have.
   Many of these technologies which are built into GNOME are new
   to developers who are accustomed to more traditional
   development environments.  If you are a developer who is new to GNOME,
   you will benefit substantially by exploring these powerful tools
   and using them to improve the power and stability of your application
   while reducing the necessary development time and effort.
