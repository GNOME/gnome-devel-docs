  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    Clutter is a library for creating dynamic user interfaces using OpenGL for hardware acceleration. This example demonstates a small, but central, part of the Clutter library to create a simple but attractive image viewing program.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help us reach our goal we will be utilising a few other common pieces of GLib as well. Most importantly, we'll use one <code>GSList</code>, a singlely-linked list, to hold our <code>ClutterActor</code>s and another for file path names. We will also use <code>GDir</code> for accessing our image directory and gathering file paths.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <title>Building the example</title>
  <p>
    In order to build the example you'll need to run the following command from the directory containing the source file.
  </p>
  <screen>
    gcc -g -o clutter-image-viewer `pkg-config --cflags clutter-1.0` `pkg-config --libs clutter-1.0` clutter-image-viewer.c
  </screen>
  <p>
    If you are unfamiliar with compiling C programs, the above line creates a binary file <code>-o clutter-image-viewer</code> using the c source file clutter-image-viewer.c. We use the <code>-g</code> flag to generate debug symbols which is always a good idea during the development stage. The bit between the <code>`</code> pairs shows how to use the <code>pkg-config</code> tool to insert other flags and libraries needed for compilation.
  </p>

<section>
  <title>A look at the image viewer</title>
  <p>
    Our image viewer presents the user with a "wall" of images.
  </p>
  <media type="image" mime="image/png" src="clutter-image-viewer/clutter-image-viewer-wall.png"/>
  <p>When an image is clicked, it's animated to fill the viewing area. When the image having focus is clicked it's returned to it's original position using an animation with the same duration of 500 milliseconds.
  </p>
  <media type="image" mime="image/png" src="clutter-image-viewer/clutter-image-viewer-zoomed.png"/>

  <title>Setting up our image actors</title>
<p>
  As mentioned, we are going to take a closer look at the loop used for setting up the <code>ClutterActor</code>s.

</code>
<list>
  <item><p>Line 5: Here we want to get the path at the nth location in the <code>GSList</code> that is holding our image path names. The nth position is calculated based on the row and col. The return value is a pointer to a <code>GSList</code> which is just a node in the list. We will use this to get the actual path in the next line. The first parameter is a pointer to the head of the list.</p>
  </item>
  <item><p>Line 6: This is where we actually create the <code>ClutterActor</code> and place the image into the actor. The first argument is the path which we access through our <code>GSList</code> node. The second argument is for error reporting but we are ignoring that to keep things short.</p>
  </item>
  <item><p>Line 7: We'll look at this function in a later section.</p>
  </item>
  <item><p>Line 8: This adds the <code>ClutterActor</code> to the stage, which is a container. It also assumes ownership of the <code>ClutterActor</code> which is something you'll want to look into as you get deeper into GNOME development.</p>
  </item>
  <item><p>Line 9: This adds our <code>ClutterActor</code> to a <code>GSList</code> so that we can later iterate over the <code>ClutterActor</code>s.</p>
<note><p>Interesting to note is that we want to prepend the <code>ClutterActor</code>s rather than append so that we avoid traversing the list upon each insertion. You will often see <code>g_slist_prepend</code> followed by <code>g_slist_reverse</code> because it faster than inserting many objects to the end of the list.</p></note>

    <item><p>Lines 13-19: Reaching this code means that one image currently has focus and we want to return to wall mode.

<p>Depth also determines which <code>ClutterActor</code>s receive events. A <code>ClutterActor</code> with a higher depth value receives the click events and can choose whether the event gets sent to <code>ClutterActor</code>s under it. We'll see how that works in a few steps.</p></note>
