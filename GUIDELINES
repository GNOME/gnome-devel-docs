Send patches, reviews and suggestions to usability@gnome.org, or
file a bug against the HIG at bugzilla.gnome.org.

---ChangeLog entries---

Please include a ChangeLog entry, even for small changes,
explaining the change and perhaps the motivation behind it
if that is not immediately clear. This applies to changes
in content and smaller structural or grammatical changes.

When adding a new section or guideline, or revising an 
existing guideline, please also add a one sentence summary
of the change, and an xref link to the enclosing section,
to the relevant part of hig-ch-whatsnew.xml.

---Markup---

It is preferable if markup is indented to match the rest
of the document (or the markup of the surroundings if there
is an inconsistency).

<sectN> tags should include an id element, for 
example, <sect1 id="foobar-in-action">, as this keeps
the generated HTML filenames human readable, and also will 
allow linking to specific sections in the HIG.

Please name sect1 IDs in the format "chaptername-sect1name".
E.g. for <chapter id="feedback">, use IDs such as
<sect1 id="feedback-cursor">, <sect1 id="feedback-dialogs">
etc.  If we decide to go with one HTML page per sect1, rather
than per chapter, this will keep the names of the HTML files
more consistent.

---Unpublished Comments---

If you are a reviewer or author and want to add a comment
aimed at other reviewers/authors, use:

<remark>Whatever you want to say -Author</remark>

This will appear in developer builds, but not in the final output.
Its best if you attribute the remark to yourself :-)
