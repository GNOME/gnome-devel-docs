<title>Menu bars</title>

<p>A menubar incorporates a strip of drop-down menus. It is typically located at the top of a primary window, below a window title bar.</p>

<p>The menubar is normally visible at all times and is always accessible from the keyboard, so make all the commands available in your application available on the menubar.</p>

<section id="when-to-use">
<title>When to use</title>

<p>Menu bars increase the vertical footprint of an application's user interface, introduce a large number of disclosure points, and function as a fixed set of inflexible options. For these reasons, <link xref="header-bars">header bars</link> and <link xref="header-bar-menus">header bar menus</link> are generally recommended over menu bars, along with other design patterns for exposing controls on demand, such as <link xref="selection-mode">selection mode</link>, <link xref="action-bars">action bars</link>, and <link xref="popovers">popovers"</link>.</p>

<p>At the same time, menu bars can still be an appropriate choice, particularly for applications that already incorporate a header bar. Some platforms also incorporate space for a menu bar in their user environment, and a menu model can be desirable for cross-platform integration purposes.</p>

<section id="general-guidelines">
<title>General guidelines</title>

<list>
<item><p>Do not disable menu titles. Allow the user to explore the menu, even though there might be no available items on it at that time.</p></item>
<item><p>Menu titles on a menubar are single words with their first letter capitalized. Do not use spaces in menu titles, as this makes them easily-mistaken for two separate menu titles. Do not use compound words (such as <gui>WindowOptions</gui>) or hyphens (such as <gui>Window-Options</gui>) to circumvent this guideline.</p></item>
<item><p>Do not provide a mechanism for hiding the menubar, as this may be activated accidentally. Some users will not be able to figure out how to get the menu bar back in this case.</p></item>

<section id="standard-menus">
<title>Standard menus</title>

<p>This section details the most common menus and menu items in a menu bar.</p>

<section id="file">
<title>File</title>

<p>The <gui>File</gui> menu contains commands that operate on the current document. It is the left-most item in the menubar because of its importance and frequency of use, and because it is a relevant menu in many applications. Historically, because most applications already had this menu, and because the distinction between closing documents and closing windows became blurred over time, the <gui>File</gui> menu has also become the standard location for <gui>Quit</gui>.</p>

<p>The items on the <gui>File</gui> menu are generally ordered by locality, closest first. That is, items to save or load from file, followed by printing, followed by sending to a remote user. Try to maintain this ordering if you have to add new items to the menu.</p>

<p>If your application does not operate on documents, name this item for the type of object it displays. For example, many games should have a <gui>Game</gui> instead of a <gui>File</gui> menu. However, place the <gui>Quit</gui> menu item last on this menu nonetheless.</p>

<section id="format">
<title>Format</title>

<p>A <gui>Format</gui> menu contains commands to change the visual appearance of the document. For example, changing the font, color, or line spacing of a text selection.</p>

<p>The difference between these commands and those on the <gui>View</gui> menu is that changes made with Format commands are persistent and saved as part of the document, for example as HTML or RTF tags.</p>

<p>Items found on the Format will be very application-specific, but some common items are listed in the table below.</p>
