<title>Toolbars</title>

<p>A toolbar is a strip of controls that allows convenient access to commonly-used functions. Most toolbars only contain graphical buttons, but in more complex applications, other types of controls such as drop-down lists, can also be useful.</p>

<p>Careful and consistent toolbar design speeds up the user's task by giving direct access to functions that would otherwise be hidden on a menu. Use them only for the most important functions, however. Having too many toolbar controls reduces their efficiency by making them harder to find, and too many rows of toolbars reduces the amount of screen space available to the rest of the application.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of toolbars is increased by maintaining a level of consistency between different applications. For example, the main toolbar in an office application will nearly always have New, Open and Save as its first three toolbar buttons. Similarly, the first few buttons in a browser application should always include Back, Forward, Stop and Reload, in that order.</p>

<title>General guidelines</title>

<list>
<item><p>Place only the most commonly-used application functions on your toolbars. Don't just add buttons for every menu item.</p></item>
<item><p>All functions that appear on your toolbars must also accessible via the main menu bar, either directly (i.e. an equivalent menu item) or indirectly (e.g. in the Options â–¸ Settings dialog).</p></item>
<item><p>Arrange toolbar buttons in the same order and groupings as their equivalents on the main menu bar. In particular, always group sets of mutually-exclusive toolbar buttons.</p></item>
<item><p>Don't add buttons for <gui>Help</gui>, <gui>Close</gui> or <gui>Quit</gui> to your toolbar by default, as these are rarely used and the space is better used for more useful controls. Similarly, only provide buttons for <gui>Undo</gui>, <gui>Redo</gui> and the standard clipboard functions if there is space on the toolbar to do so without sacrificing more useful, application-specific controls.</p></item>
