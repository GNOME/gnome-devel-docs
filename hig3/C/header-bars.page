<title>Header Bars</title>

<media type="image" mime="image/png" src="figures/header-bar.png"/>

<p>Header bars are a common horizontal element which are placed at the top of windows. They play a number of roles:</p>

<list>
<item><p>Window controls - header bars allow windows to be moved by dragging, include window control buttons (typically a single close button), and provide access to a window controls menu.</p></item>
<item><p>Headings - a key role of a header bar is to provide context for the content of the window, either through a heading or view switcher.</p></item>
<item><p>Controls - header bars provide a place for key controls, typically in the form of buttons.</p></item>
</list>

<section id="context">
<title>Use Your Header Bar to Provide Context</title>

<p>Header bars should provide context for the window content below. This can either be done by placing a heading in the center of the header bar, or by including a view switcher. Providing context in this way aids navigation, and clarifies what is displayed in the window itself.</p>

<title>Controls</title>

<p>Header bars can contain key controls for the window, which can be placed on the left and right-hand side of the header bar. Examples of these controls include buttons for navigating back and forward, search, and selecting content.</p>

<p>Ensure that your header bar only contains a small number of key controls - this will help users to understand the primary functionality provided by the window, and will ensure that the window can be resized to narrow widths.</p>

<p>If a window requires more controls than can be comfortably accommodated within the header bar, additional functionality can be included within a header bar menu.</p>

<title>Header Bars are Dynamic</title>

<p>A header bar can - and should - update along with view or mode changes. This ensures that header bar controls are always relevant to the current context.</p>

<p>If the window includes multiple views (accessed through a view switcher), the header bar can include different controls for each view.</p>
