<title>Menus</title>

<p>A list of actions and/or options which is revealed by selecting a heading or button or, in the case of context menus, by using a secondary click or long press on an item of content.</p>

<title>When to use</title>

<p>Primary actions and options are typically situated in an application's <link xref="header-bars">header bar</link>. The main role of menus is to host secondary options or actions, which may not be essential to the functioning of the application, or may not be used as frequently.</p>

<p>Menus can reduce the visual footprint of your application, making it simpler at first glance, and highlighting primary functionality. They should be used when it is necessary to include actions and options that cannot be comfortably accommodated within other standard design patterns, toolbars in particular.</p>

<p>However, be wary of using a large number of menus in your application. For example: more than one menu button in a toolbar could be confusing, making it difficult for people to find particular menu items.</p>

<title>Guidelines</title>

<list>
<item><p>Do not have menus with less than three or more than about 12 top-level items. Dialog windows containing a List can be used as an alternative to menus in many situations, including this one.</p></item>
<item><p>Label menu items with verbs for commands and adjectives for settings, according to the capitalization rules in the Writing Style guidelines.</p></item>
<item><p>Make a menu item insensitive when its command is unavailable.</p></item>
<item><p>Provide an <link xref="keyboard-input#access-keys">access key</link> for every menu item. You may use the same access key on different menus in your application, but avoid duplicating access keys on the same menu. Note that unlike other controls, once a menu is displayed, its access keys may be used by just typing the letter; it is not necessary to press the Alt key at the same time.</p></item>
<item><p>Submenus are physically difficult to use, so avoid them if at all possible.</p></item>
<item><p>Never embed submenus in submenus.</p></item>
<item><p>Submenus should contain three or more items.</p></item>
<item><p>Group similar items together using dividers. The best size for a group is around 2-5 items. Single-item groups are best placed at the top or bottom of a menu, otherwise try to group them with other single items of the same type on the same menu.</p></item>
<item><p>Order items within a group logically, numerically, in task order or by expected frequency of use, as appropriate.</p></item>
<item><p>Only place one type of menu item in each groupâ€” command, mutable, check box or radio button. For example, do not place commands and settings in the same group.</p></item>
<item><p>Menus can contain <link xref="check-boxes">check boxes</link> and <link xref="radio-buttons">radio buttons</link> for settings.</p></item>

<section id="mutable-command-items">
<title>Mutable command items</title>

<p>A mutable command item changes its label when selected. For example, a Reload item may change to Stop to allow the user to interrupt the operation if it is taking a long time.</p>

<list>
<item><p>Mutable menu items can be problematic because the user never sees the menu item changing, so it is not obvious that a different function has become available.</p></item>
<item><p>Consider providing two adjacent menu items for the commands instead. Then make the items sensitive or insensitive as the situation demands.</p></item>
<item><p>Do not use mutable menu items to toggle a two-state setting (for example, Show and Hide). Use a check box or radio buttons instead.</p></item>
