  <para>There are two elements to basic integration with the user environment of the GNOME Desktop.

	Do not add launchers or other icons to the desktop when your application is installed.  The desktop is the user&apos;s space, and is reserved for icons that they explicitly request or add themselves.

       <para>The <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> menu, which appears on the panel at the top of the screen by default, is the primary mechanism by which users discover and run applications.  You place entries in this menu by installing an appropriate <filename>.desktop</filename> file.</para>

    <para>The menu is arranged into a set of categories, such as Accessories and Games. Applications are placed in particular categories by the set of keywords they include in their <filename>.desktop</filename> file. </para>

	<itemizedlist><title>Guidelines</title>

		<listitem><para>For application suites that wrap a number of smaller sub-applications into a single window, such as Evolution or OpenOffice.org, add a menu item for each sub-application. For example, the mail, calendar, and tasklist in Evolution should each have their own menu item.</para></listitem>

	<title>Include a functional description in the menu name</title>
	<para><ulink url="http://web.mit.edu/is/usability/aui/">User testing of MIT&apos;s Athena system</ulink> revealed that users had difficulty finding the file manager because they were unfamiliar with the name &quot;Nautilus&quot;. Because users did not associate the word &quot;Nautilus&quot; with the concept &quot;file manager&quot; the menu item did not help them. This is an example of not using the user&apos;s language. See <xref linkend="principles-match"/> for more on this topic.</para>

	<para>In the menu item name, include a description of functionality in addition to the proper name of the application. This is especially useful novice users, and to users of systems where numerous applications are installed by default. Users are more likely to find your application if the name that appears in the menu includes a description of its functionality.</para>

	<para>Do not include words like &quot;GNOME&quot;, &quot;X Window System&quot; or other platform details in <guimenu>Application</guimenu> menu names. The user probably already knows what platform they are using, and if they don&apos;t, then application names are not the right place to inform them.</para>

        <para>Try to imagine what words users will be looking for when they select your application from the <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> menu. That is the information that should be in the menu name. For example, a user wanting to play a movie will probably not be looking for the word &quot;Client&quot;. On the other hand, a user wanting to transmit movies from their computer may well look for the word &quot;Server&quot;.</para></tip>

    <title>Mapping Document Types to Applications</title>
    
    <para>The document type (MIME) database allows users to specify their preferred applications for opening different types of document. This is the mechanism by which Nautilus, Evolution and other applications decide which application to run when they encounter a document they cannot open themselves.</para>

    <para>It is important for users to be able to double-click on documents they see on the desktop, such as files and email messages, and have them launch in their favorite application.  Therefore, your GNOME application should associate itself at install-time with all the document types it can handle. Technical details on doing this can be found in the <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gnome-vfs"><citetitle>GnomeVFS API reference</citetitle></ulink>.</para>

    <!-- FIXME: need to cover things like the preferred list and when an application should add itself to the preferred list -->

  <sect1 id="desktop-notification-area">
	<title>Using the Status Notification Area</title>
	<para>
	The GNOME desktop features a status notification area that the user can add to any panel on their desktop.  This area is reserved for notifying the user of non-critical, application-related events (for example, arrival of new email, or a chat &apos;buddy&apos; having logged on), and for monitoring the status of system tasks (for example, network or printer activity, or laptop battery charging).</para>

	<para>Following the guidelines in this section will help to clarify the difference in the user&apos;s mind between information presented in the notification area, and controls and information presented on other parts of the panel.</para>

	<sect2 id="desktop-notification-or-applet"><title>Notification Area or Panel Applet?</title>
	<para>
	Possible rule of thumb: you should probably write an applet instead of using the notification area if:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>clicking your notification area icon does anything other than opening a window directly associated with the icon (e.g. a mail folder window for a new mail icon, or a print queue window for printer notification icon), or </para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>there are icon-specific options on its context menu for doing anything other than that</para></listitem>

	<sect2><title>Icon Appearance</title>
	<itemizedlist><title>Guidelines</title>
		<listitem><para>Use table perspective for icons representing physical devices, with the light source above and to the left of the represented object.  For example, a printer icon during printing. See <xref linkend="icon_style_perspective"/> for more about table perspective.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Use shelf perspective, with overhead lighting, for all other icons. For example, an envelope shown when new mail arrives. See <xref linkend="icon_style_perspective"/> for more about shelf perspective.</para></listitem>	
		<listitem><para>Use flat images for perpetual displays that change over
time, such as load meters. Clearly delimit the boundaries of flat images.

a scrolling green bar graph on a black background should have a
one black pixel border.</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>Icons should not usually appear animated. The may change to
indicate a change of state, but should not do so when that change
is occurs regularly rapidly. A battery status indicator would
usually change slowly, therefore an icon is appropriate. By contrast,
a load meter would always be changing, therefore it should use a flat
image.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Icons are permitted to blink under a few conditions.
 An icon may blink for n (=5?) seconds when first displayed
   if showing the icon is not caused by user action.
   A printing-in-progress icon would be shown because the user
   is printing a document, therefore it should not blink.
   An incoming email or personal message (IM) would be shown
   because something has changed absent the user, therefore it
   may blink.</para></listitem>

 		<listitem><para>A icon may blink for n seconds if its conditions for initially
   blinking recur. For example, an incoming email icon which was
   shown and blinked when a message arrived and which has remained
   visible may blink again when another message arrives.</para></listitem>

 		<listitem><para>Any icon may blink to indicate an error in deference to showing
   an alert. For example, a printing-in-progress icon may blink when
   there is a paper jam, but not when the printer is on fire - that
   should show an alert.
   </para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Do not rely on blinking or animation as a means of alerting the user to any particular event.  The notification area respects the global desktop "no animation" preference for accessibility reasons. <remark>Note: This doesn&apos;t exist yet but it&apos;s on the list...</remark></para></listitem>
